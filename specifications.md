## Frontend Implementation

The frontend uses a simple, lightweight approach with vanilla HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript:

- **HTML**: Semantic markup with templates for reusability
- **CSS**: Clean, modular stylesheets with variables for theming
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JS with minimal dependencies, focusing on:
  - Form handling and validation
  - YAML parsing and preview
  - UI state management
  - API communication

Always prioritize implementing features in the backend when possible, rather than adding complexity to the frontend. Keep JavaScript minimal and focused on essential user interactions.

---

## Backend Implementation

The backend uses **FastAPI**, served with **Uvicorn**, and handles:

- Validation of assistant YAML files  
- Loading schema defaults  
- Assistant generation (future via OpenAI)  
- Template persistence  
- User authentication and storage (via SQLite)  

### YAML Validation Endpoint

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile
import yaml
from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError
from app.schema_loader import load_schema

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/validate")
async def validate_yaml(file: UploadFile):
    content = await file.read()
    data = yaml.safe_load(content)
    schema = load_schema()

    try:
        validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
        return {"valid": True}
    except ValidationError as e:
        return {"valid": False, "error": e.message, "path": list(e.absolute_path)}
```

---

## Database Layer

- **SQLite** is used for simplicity and portability  
- **SQLAlchemy** models define users and assistant records  
- User templates and saved YAMLs are stored locally or optionally exported  
- Future versions may support remote/cloud sync  

---
## Implementation Notes

- **Schema-Driven Philosophy**: `schema.yaml` is the authoritative source for assistant configuration; the frontend adapts dynamically to its structure  
- **Editor Modes**: The UI supports toggling between simple and advanced views, enabling accessibility for educators and power users alike  
- **Validation First**: YAML configurations are validated on load, save, and export — errors are clearly reported with schema paths  
- **OpenAI Integration (Planned)**: Assistant enhancements and suggestions will be offered through backend interaction with OpenAI's API  
- **Lightweight by Design**: Tailwind + Shadcn UI in the frontend, and SQLite in the backend, allow the system to remain performant and easily deployable  


# ADL Builder
## Project Overview
ADLBuilder is a tool designed to streamline the creation of structured, reusable assistant configurations in YAML format, enabling seamless integration with AI wrappers like ChatGPT, OpenWebUI, and others. By offering a user-friendly interface for defining assistant behavior, personality, and domain-specific instructions, ADLBuilder empowers developers, educators, and AI designers to prototype, document, and deploy customized assistants efficiently. The project bridges the gap between natural language prompt engineering and modular software configuration, promoting clarity, reusability, and version control in assistant design workflows.

### Vision Statement
ADLBuilder envisions a future where designing intelligent assistants is as intuitive, transparent, and standardized as writing code. By empowering creators to define assistant behavior through clear, modular, and portable descriptions, we aim to foster an open ecosystem of interoperable, ethical, and domain-aware AI agents that can be trusted, shared, and continuously improved by diverse communities.

### Problem Statement
While the creation of AI assistants through natural language system prompts has become more accessible, the process remains largely informal, unstructured, and limited in scope. Current approaches typically rely on ad-hoc textual descriptions of an assistant’s personality and high-level goals, but they fall short when more advanced behavior is needed. In particular:

- They lack mechanisms to define specific task-oriented capabilities that can be invoked reliably.
- They do not support modular, reusable configurations for behavior, tone, and knowledge boundaries.
- They fail to facilitate multi-step workflows or dynamic guidance processes between the assistant and the user.
- They are often tied to a specific wrapper or platform, limiting portability and interoperability.
- They offer no standardized way to document, version, or share assistant specifications within teams or communities.

As a result, building consistent, transparent, and maintainable AI assistants remains a manual and error-prone process, especially when designing agents intended for specialized or professional contexts.

### Solution
**ADLBuilder** offers a structured, user-friendly environment for designing and managing assistant definitions through a modular, YAML-based Assistant Description Language (ADL). The platform enables users to:

- Define assistants using **structured components**: personality, goals, capabilities, tone, constraints, workflows, and contextual knowledge  
- Build **task-specific modules** (TOOLS: Commands, Options and Decorators) that can be composed, reused, and shared across different assistants  
- Preview and validate assistant configurations across **multiple AI wrappers** (e.g., ChatGPT, OpenWebUI)  
- Export assistant definitions in **portable, version-controlled YAML files**, compatible with collaborative development environments  
- Maintain a **library of assistant templates**, fostering reuse and standardization within organizations or communities  
- Support **role-specific behavior** and domain adaptation through context injection and conditional logic  

By combining expressive power with structure and portability, ADLBuilder makes it possible to design assistants that go beyond chatty personas—enabling reliable, maintainable, and transparent assistant behaviors tailored to real-world tasks.


### Target Audience
Primary focus: Educators and developers interested in creating structured, high-functioning AI assistants, specifically:

- **Teachers and educators** who want to build assistants that:
  - Help students achieve defined learning objectives
  - Provide on-demand support for common questions and conceptual doubts
  - Guide students through learning processes and foster academic success

- **Advanced users and developers** seeking to:
  - Design assistants capable of handling **complex, multi-step tasks**
  - Ensure **behavioral consistency and reliability** across use cases
  - Leverage modular, reusable assistant logic for domain-specific applications


### Success Metrics

The success of ADLBuilder will be measured by:

- **Time-to-build**: How quickly users (educators or professionals) can design and deploy advanced, task-capable assistants using the ADLBuilder interface  
- **Time-saved-in-use**: The degree to which these assistants reduce repetitive workload, offer autonomous guidance, or streamline user interaction processes  
- **Adoption rate among educators and AI practitioners**, particularly in contexts where assistant consistency and task specificity are critical  
- **Reuse and sharing of assistant modules**, indicating the emergence of a community-driven ecosystem around structured assistant design


### Project Scope – Version 1.0

Initial release will focus on enabling users to create fully compliant ADL (Assistant Description Language) files through a guided interface that covers:

1. **Metadata editor**  
   - Author information (name, role, organization, contact)  
   - Description fields: title, summary, coverage, educational level, use cases, keywords  
   - Visibility settings and licensing (e.g., CC by-sa 4.0)  
   - Version history tracking  

2. **Instruction builder for assistant behavior**  
   - Define assistant's **role** and mission  
   - Configure **context**: scope of use, integration strategy, and user data handling policies  
   - Define **style guidelines**: tone, level of detail, and formatting rules  
   - Write customizable **help text** and **final notes** for assistant behavior  
   - Set detailed **behavior rules**: greetings, error handling, help command responses, topic restrictions, and prompt visibility  

3. **Capability configuration**  
   - Add and manage task-specific capabilities  
   - Control the assistant's interpretation and chaining of commands/options/decorators  

4. **Tools system definition**  
   - Define **commands** (`/command`) with display name, description, and execution prompts  
   - Configure **options** (`/option`) that modify command behavior  
   - Add **decorators** (`+++decorator`) to apply behavioral constraints or refinements  

5. **YAML export and validation**  
   - Generate complete, standards-compliant ADL files in YAML  
   - Validate structural and logical integrity of the configurations  

6. **Template-based creation**  
   - Provide starter templates for common assistant types (e.g., study guide assistant, document summarizer, concept explainer)  

7. **Dual editing modes**
   - **Simple mode**: exposes only fields marked as `x-category: custom`, allowing quick assistant creation without overwhelming complexity  
   - **Advanced mode**: enables full control over all schema fields, including `x-category: system`, for expert users or developers  
   - **Toggle system**: to switch modes at any time, preserving unsaved changes

This version will prioritize structured expressiveness, configuration clarity, and file portability to ensure immediate utility for educators and professionals building assistants with advanced behaviors.

### Risk Assessment

1. **Technical Risks**
   - Ensuring schema validation and compatibility across diverse AI wrappers (e.g., ChatGPT, OpenWebUI)
   - Maintaining robustness and coherence in the generated YAML structures
   - Complexity in supporting advanced logic (e.g., decorators, multi-step workflows) within a user-friendly UI

2. **User Experience Risks**
   - Learning curve for non-technical users unfamiliar with YAML or assistant configuration logic
   - Risk of assistants behaving inconsistently if user-defined instructions are poorly structured
   - Difficulty in testing and previewing assistant behavior in real-world scenarios without live model integration

3. **Adoption & Strategic Risks**
   - Perception that structured assistant design is too complex compared to simple prompt writing
   - Limited initial user base if the educational and professional segments are not actively targeted
   - Competition from general-purpose prompt libraries or platform-specific assistant builders


### Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:

1. **Technical Implementation**
   - All schema components defined in `schema.yaml` are editable via the user interface  
   - Exported YAML files are fully valid and interoperable with at least two major AI wrappers  
   - The system is performant, stable, and easy to extend for future assistant capabilities

   - At least 80% of beta testers report increased efficiency or clarity in assistant design  
   - Strong retention and reuse of assistant templates across user sessions  

3. **Strategic and Ecosystem Objectives**
   - First release delivered on time and within development constraints  
   - Differentiation from simple prompt-based tools is clearly recognized by early adopters  
   - The platform seeds an initial ecosystem of reusable assistant modules (e.g., via template library or YAML sharing)

4. **User Accessibility and Flexibility**
   - Both simple and advanced editing modes are fully functional and switchable  
   - Simple mode users can create usable assistants without needing schema expertise  
   - Advanced users can fully customize assistant behavior and logic using all schema components

## Key Design Justifications

- **FastAPI Backend**: All critical logic—such as YAML validation against `schema.yaml`, AI-assisted assistant refinement, and template logic—resides on the backend to minimize frontend complexity and enforce schema integrity.

- **Dual Editor Modes**: The frontend offers a *Simple Mode* that only exposes fields marked as `x-category: custom`, and an *Advanced Mode* that includes `x-category: system` fields for full control. This separation improves accessibility for non-technical users while retaining flexibility for power users.

- **Centralized Schema Management**: The canonical `schema.yaml` file is loaded and interpreted by the backend, allowing:
  - Real-time schema validation
  - Schema-driven UI generation (optional)
  - Future-proofing via version control or schema extension

- **OpenAI Integration (Planned)**: The backend architecture anticipates integration with LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI) to assist in:
  - Suggesting improvements to assistant definitions
  - Autocompleting fields based on goals or use cases
  - Generating consistent behavior templates

- **Modular Frontend**: The React app follows a modular structure to:
  - Support reusable components (e.g., for YAML editing, previewing)
  - Enable quick iteration of UI modes and views
  - Prepare for future features like assistant simulation or real-time collaboration

This architectural approach keeps the system **coherent, extensible, and maintainable** as new capabilities are added, while supporting both educational and professional users effectively.
